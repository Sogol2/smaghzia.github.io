    <h2>Checklist</h2>

<ol class="review-checklist">
  <li>
    ✔ Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed (or if instructed the primary page with links to the page, or both)
  </li>

  <li>
    There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc..
    <ul>
      <li>✘ Some file names use upper-case letters (for example <code>clientLCCproject.css</code> and <code>HTMLInclude.min.js</code>); the guideline prefers all lowercase.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Design
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        ✔ Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ Page has site colors and fonts using the standard css file, unless this assignment requires a unique/standalone/embedded one
      </li>
      <li>
        CRAP
        <ol>
          <li>
            ✔ Contrast
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ Repetition
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ Alignment
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity
            <ul>
              <li>✘ Some related items (like service times and mission text) could be grouped a little closer to emphasize their connection.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Page has within it:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        ✔ Header
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ Main
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ Footer
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ (optional) nav for main menu between header and main
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Header has site/brand header with text in an h1
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        ✔ If this is a homework page it's likely something like Student Name * Course ID Course Name
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ If this is a "branded page" it should be the brand/company
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ DO NOT INCLUDE THE PAGE NAME IN THE HEADER
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ Understand the difference between head, header, and heading
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    ✔ Main starts with name of page as an h2 and does not include name of site/brand
  </li>

  <li>
    Page has brand tagline somewhere (make up a slogan and include it on every page in a consistent location)
    <ul>
      <li>✘ I don’t see a short tagline separate from the mission statement; adding a slogan and repeating it in header or footer would strengthen the brand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Page has footer with
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        ✔ Menu for user's pages
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ Page has html validation button/link and validates
      </li>
      <li>
        ✔ Page has css validation button/link and validates
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    ✔ Page has specific requirements for this assignment (make a checklist from that assignment and make sure you've covered everything there). If there is a conflict between what you see here and in the instructions, ask on the class forums about it.
  </li>
</ol>


    <h3>8. Summary – Stop, Start, Continue</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Continue:</strong> using warm, welcoming text and clearly listing times and directions;
          this is very helpful for first-time visitors.</li>
      <li><strong>Start:</strong> tightening up the rubric details: all-lowercase file names,
          cleaner page title, and a main heading that is just the page name.</li>
    </ul>
