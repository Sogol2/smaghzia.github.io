    <ol class="review-checklist">

      </li>

            ✔ Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read
            
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ Page has site colors and fonts using the standard css file, unless this assignment requires a unique/standalone/embedded one
        
          </li>
          <li>
            CRAP
            <ol>
              <li>
                ✔ Contrast
              </li>
              <li>
                ✔ Repetition
              </li>
              <li>
                ✔ Alignment
              </li>
              <li>
                ✔ Proximity
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        Page has within it:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            ✔ Header
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ Main
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ Footer
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        Header has site/brand header with text in an h1
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            ✔ If this is a homework page it's likely something like Student Name * Course ID Course Name
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ If this is a "branded page" it should be the brand/company
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ DO NOT INCLUDE THE PAGE NAME IN THE HEADER
          </li>
          <li>
            ✔ Understand the difference between head, header, and heading
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        Main starts with name of page as an h2 and does not include name of site/brand
        <ul>
          <li>✘ Main currently starts with headings like “Welcome to DOM Tutorials”, which repeats the site name. The rubric suggests using only the page name (for example “Home”, “DOM Tutorials”, or “Tutorials Overview”) without repeating the brand.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        ✔ Page has brand tagline somewhere (make up a slogan and include it on every page in a consistent location)
      </li>

      <li>
        Page has footer with
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Menu for user's pages
            <ul>
              <li>✘ The footer currently only credits “Mathews Unlimited”; there is no menu of page links here. Navigation is handled well in the header, but the rubric suggests adding a footer menu or key links.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Page has html validation button/link and validates
            <ul>
              <li>✘ No HTML validation button or link is visible yet; these should be added (typically in the footer) once the page validates.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Page has css validation button/link and validates
            <ul>
              <li>✘ CSS validation button/link is also not visible; should be added for the <code>css/style.css</code> file after validation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        ✔ Page has specific requirements for this assignment (make a checklist from that assignment and make sure you've covered everything there). If there is a conflict between what you see here and in the instructions, ask on the class forums about it.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Summary – Stop, Start, Continue</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Continue:</strong> using a clear nav bar and consistent card-style layouts for tutorials; it makes the site easy to explore.</li>
      <li><strong>Start:</strong> adjusting page headings so the main <code>h2</code> is just the page name (without repeating “DOM Tutorials”) and adding validation buttons + a small footer menu.</li>
    </ul>
